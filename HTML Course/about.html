    <h1>Hi, I'm samy, or nuckypuck</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>I'm a student @ university studying <strong>computer science.</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>I research into any topics that interest me, such as computing. (That's where I get all my trivial knowledge.)</li>
        <li>I enjoy games (too many to list) and activities such as rugby, climbing and skiing.</li>
        <li>I studied computer science, politics & finance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Currently I'm working with a variety of programming languages to develop my fluency in them and my skills in coding. I'm also revising maths from GCSE, A-Level and up to University Level as it'll assist me in my course and it's generally a good skill to have.</p>
    <p>If I'd do anything differently, I'd have picked a science (Chemistry or Physics), maths and further maths, and kept comp sci and finance. I didn't genuinely begin enjoying these subjects the way I did and studying them until I got to university, but it's never too late to start!</p>
